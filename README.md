        Movies In React !
    About the project:
Movies in React is a single-page application built using React Js, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. The application's Home page has some random movie posters. Also, I put several upcoming movie trailers from youtube. Users can watch trailers in full screen also. Next, on the Movies page
Users will see movie cards, where you can give the movie a star, read a little summary, or even delete the movie. Also, users can filter movies by genre. You can also add a new movie using the form "add movie." To add a movie user needs to find basic information online like "title," "year," "poster," "genre," and" about" -a summary of the movie, and fill in the form inputs. And, of course, we need to add "id" and "star." Once all the information is submitted, the application will re-render, and a new movie will appear on the Movies page.
I used Tailwind CSS to create a horizontal scroll  of random movie posters just for fun. It is elementary to install and use in your app.
